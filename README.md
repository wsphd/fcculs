Summary:
This R script contains two main parts:

1. Download the relevant FCC ULS Database files, and
2. Combine them in a way that a 'HAM/Scanner' user might find useful

There isn't enough room on GitHub to host the resulting datasets, so they are posted at:
[https://smithw.org/scma/]: /url "FCC ULS CA SoCal Counties data"

Details:
I've made specific decisions about the data.  It should be relatively easy to modify the code alter these assumptions.  Specifically,

1. Inclusion
* I've included the ten counties in SoCal from the Mexican border to both Kern and San luis Obisbo in the north.
* I've included only the 'Active' licenses
2. Exclusion
